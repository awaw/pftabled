.Nm pftabled
.Nd Remote PF table helper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pftabled
.Op Fl a Ar address
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar table
.Op Fl k Ar keyfile
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar table
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is a small helper to make your
.Xr pf 4
tables reachable from other hosts.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dfxaddress
.It Fl a Ar address
Bind to this address (default: 0.0.0.0).
.It Fl d
Run as daemon in the background and log to system logfiles.
Defaults to run in the foreground and log to standard error.
.It Fl f Ar table
Force client requests to use this table.
Ignores client supplied table name.
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Read authentication key from
.Ar keyfile .
Needs to be at least 20 bytes large.
.It Fl p Ar port
Bind to this port (default: 56789).
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Delete addresses from table after
.Ar timeout
seconds. With this option enabled
.Nm
needs more memory (approx. 16 bytes per active address).
.It Fl v
Log all received commands.
.El
.Sh AUTHENTICATION
Client requests are authenticated by a HMAC-SHA1 keyed hash.
A secret keyfile with at least 20 bytes of key material is needed.
It may be generated from random data by
.Pp
.Dl # dd if=/dev/arandom of=/etc/pftabled.key bs=20 count=1
.Dl # chmod 0400 /etc/pftabled.key
.Pp
and distributed securely (see
.Xr scp 1 )
to the participating hosts.
Securing the receiving port by adequate
.Xr pf 4
rules is still recommended.
.Sh WIRE FORMAT
The
.Nm
daemon accepts UDP datagrams of the following format:
